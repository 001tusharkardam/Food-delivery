Online Food Delivery Order Manager
Project Description

The Online Food Delivery Order Manager is a simple web-based application designed to manage food delivery orders efficiently. The system allows users to add food orders, view all existing orders, filter them based on payment status and delivery distance, and automatically assign delivery to the nearest unpaid order.

This project focuses on implementing basic order management logic, filtering operations, and distance-based prioritization using a clean and user-friendly interface. The application works completely on the client side and stores data temporarily during runtime.

*****How the System Works*****

The user adds a new order by entering order details such as order ID, restaurant name, number of items, payment status, and delivery distance.

All added orders are displayed in the orders list.

The user can filter orders based on payment status and maximum delivery distance.

When the Assign Delivery option is used, the system selects the nearest unpaid order within the given distance.

If no unpaid order matches the criteria, the system displays a message indicating that no order is available.
